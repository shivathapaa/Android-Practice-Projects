# Android Practice Projects
Welcome to my repository! These projects were developed during the early phases of my Android development journey. Please note that they do not represent my complete projects or my recent work that I uphold. And do ignore the project names as they are simply for convenience. For my latest work, please refer to my other repositories.

## Why this repository?
This repository contains my practice projects, serving as reference points for some of the projects I have completed and am currently working on. While they may not hold significant value for you, they are invaluable to me as indicators of my progress and serve as reference checkpoints. :)
